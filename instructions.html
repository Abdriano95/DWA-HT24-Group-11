<h1>Memory Game Instructions</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of the memory game is to find all matching pairs of cards. The game is won when all pairs have been matched.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Start the Game:</strong> When you open the game, you will see a grid of facedown cards.</li>
    <li><strong>Flip Two Cards:</strong> Click on any card to flip it over and reveal the symbol or letter on the other side. Click on a second card to flip it over as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for a Match:</strong> If the symbols or letters on the two flipped cards match, they remain face up. If they do not match, after a short delay, both cards will flip back over to their facedown positions.</li>
    <li><strong>Continue Playing:</strong> Repeat steps 2 and 3, flipping two cards at a time, until all pairs have been found.</li>
    <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The game is over when all pairs of cards have been matched and are face up. Congratulations, youâ€™ve won the game!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips and Strategies</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Remember the Cards:</strong> Pay close attention to the symbols or letters on the cards you have flipped over. Try to remember their positions to match pairs more effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Take Your Time:</strong> There is no time limit, so take your time to memorize card positions.</li>
    <li><strong>Concentration:</strong> The key to winning is concentration. Try to focus and avoid distractions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Restarting the Game:</strong> If you want to play again, refresh the browser page to shuffle the cards and start a new game.</li>
    <li><strong>Customizing the Game:</strong> For more advanced players, you can increase the difficulty by using a larger grid or more diverse symbols.</li>
